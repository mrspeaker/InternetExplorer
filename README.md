# Internet Explorer

Reddit ImgUr Explorer, made for the VR devices.

[Try it out on the internets](http://mrspeaker.github.io/InternetExplorer/) (really needs VR-enabled browser, but eh...)

Loads subreddit ImgUrl images as a 3d gallery. You can use it in a normal ol' browser, but it doesn't feel like you're browsing the future: so go get a Rift and a browser with VR support - see [MozVR.com](http://www.mozvr.com) or [Chrome builds](http://blog.tojicode.com/2014/07/bringing-vr-to-chrome.html).

**Controls:**

    / to enter typing mode. Type a subreddit and hit enter.
    WSAD: Move
    Arrows: Rotate
    Q/E: Up 'n down
    Space: Remove an obelisk.
    Enter: When you are looking at a "/r/<subreddit>" obelisk, loads the subreddit.
    Z: reset VR sensor.

## Notes

  * The base code (things in /lib: VRManager, VREffect etc) is from the [Sechelt demo](https://github.com/MozVR/sechelt)
  * If data isn't loading, make sure you aren't ad-blocking/anti-tracking reddit. Firefox is blocking reddit api calls by default

## Todos

  * mouse looks left/right (same as arrow keys)
  * R should reset sensor (not Z, or and Z)
  * typing doesn't disable movment
  * making shadows
  * handle imgur galleries
  * stagger image loading (tonnes of requests is slow in firefox)
  * non-square images
  * downscale big images (not even needed for Oculus rez)
  * faster moving. Double-tap-to-run, or shift run.
