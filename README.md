# Worldt

Made for Oculus, so needs a browser with Oculus support - see [MozVR.com](http://www.mozvr.com).

Code uses a bunch of ES6 stuff - I'm using [jspm.io](http://jspm.io/) for building.

Base code (Stuff in /lib: VRManager, VREffect etc) is from the [Sechelt demo](https://github.com/MozVR/sechelt)

## Notes:

type "/" to enter text mode (no gui yet!). Type a subreddit and hit enter, it will load any imgurlses.

Q/E: up n down
wasd: directions
arrows: rotation
"space" to remove an obelisk.
"enter" to load a "/r/..." oblisk.
