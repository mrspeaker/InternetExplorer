# Worldt

Reddit ImgUr Explorer, made for the Oculus Rift.

Loads subreddit ImgUrl images as a 3d gallery. You can use it in a normal ol' browser, but it doesn't feel like you're browsing the future: so go get a Rift and a browser with VR support - see [MozVR.com](http://www.mozvr.com) or [Chrome builds](http://blog.tojicode.com/2014/07/bringing-vr-to-chrome.html).

**Controls:**

    / to enter typing mode. Type a subreddit and hit enter.
    WSAD: Move
    Arrows: Rotate
    Q/E: Up 'n down
    Space: Remove an obelisk.
    Enter: When you are looking at a "/r/<subreddit>" obelisk, loads the subreddit.
    Z: reset VR sensor.

## Notes

The code uses a bunch of ES6 stuff: I'm using [jspm.io](http://jspm.io/) for building.

The base code (things in /lib: VRManager, VREffect etc) is from the [Sechelt demo](https://github.com/MozVR/sechelt)
