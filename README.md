# Worldt

Reddit ImgUr world. Made for Oculus Rift: so needs a browser with Oculus support - see [MozVR.com](http://www.mozvr.com).

**Controls:**

Type "/" to enter text mode (no gui yet - you have to type blindly!). Type a subreddit and hit enter, it will load any imgurls.

    WSAD: Move
    Arrows: Rotate
    Q/E: Up 'n down
    Space: Remove an obelisk.
    Enter: When you are looking at a "/r/<subreddit>" oblisk, loads the subreddit.

Code uses a bunch of ES6 stuff - I'm using [jspm.io](http://jspm.io/) for building.

Base code (Stuff in /lib: VRManager, VREffect etc) is from the [Sechelt demo](https://github.com/MozVR/sechelt)
